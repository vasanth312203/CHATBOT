Description :

Unlock the power of conversational AI by embarking on a journey to create your very own ChatBot interface using the  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This hands-on project combines the structural elements of HTML, the styling finesse of CSS, and the interactive capabilities of JavaScript to craft an engaging chatbot experience.

HTML (chat.html)

Begin by defining the skeletal structure of your chat interface using HTML. Set up the necessary elements for the chat window, input field, and message containers. Organize the layout to provide a clean and user-friendly design.

CSS (style.css)

Elevate the visual appeal of your chat interface with CSS styling. Apply aesthetic choices for colors, fonts, and layout to create a seamless and visually pleasing experience. Use CSS to ensure responsiveness and adaptability to different screen sizes.

JAVA SCRIPT ( script.js )

 The heartbeat of your ChatBot interface lies in the interactivity enabled by JavaScript. Implement event listeners to capture user input, create functions for processing messages, and dynamically update the chat window. Utilize JavaScript to seamlessly integrate the chatbot logic and responses. 
 
 Integration with OpenAI API :
 
Take your project to the next level by integrating it with the OpenAI GPT API for more sophisticated natural language processing. This step involves making API requests to the OpenAI servers, handling responses, and seamlessly integrating the generated responses into your chat interface.
